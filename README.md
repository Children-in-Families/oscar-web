### Requirements

- Docker Desktop (latest stable version for your platform)

### Getting Started

Given that we are using Docker, then most common development tasks you will just need the _core services_ which are essentially the OSCaR App Service (Rails) and the OSCaR Database Service (Postgres). To spin these services up only, use the following `make` command:

```
make start_core
```

This starts a Rails, Postgres and Webpack container. If you need the Mongo container running then execute the following command in a separate terminal:

```
make start_mongo
```

See the project [Makefile](./Makefile) for a list of all the available commands.

Once the containers have fired up open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open the app. To login, click on the 'dev' organizations logo (there should only be the one logo) and the username (email) is any of the users (listed in the 'users' sheet) of the [lib/devdata/dev_tenant.xlsx](lib/devdata/dev_tenant.xlsx) spreadsheet with the password set to `123456789`.

_NOTE_ If this is the first time you have run this you may need to stop the containers and run it again!

## Debugging using Pry

If you want to debug the Rails application using Pry you need to attach to the container running Rails first. To do that in a new terminal window run:

```
make rails_attach
```

Now when your code runs and gets to the `binding.pry` line it will halt and a Pry REPL session will be available in the terminal window where you are attached.

When you have finished dubugging just type `exit` in the Pry REPL session as you normally would. Keep this terminal attached for convenience if you need to use Pry again.

NOTE: To detach the tty **without also terminating the Rails container**, you need to use the escape sequence **Ctrl+P** followed by **Ctrl+Q**.

## Troubleshooting

#### Issue pending migrations when starting Docker container

If you have pending migrations that **prevent the Docker container from starting** for example:

```
app | You have 2 pending migrations:
app |   20200603071312 ________
app |   20200603081325 ________
app | Run `rake db:migrate` to update your database then try again.
app exited with code 1
```

Then you can fix this by running the following command and then starting services again.

```
make db_migrate
```
