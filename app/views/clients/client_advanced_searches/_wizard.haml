              .col-xs-12
                %p A common mistake with AND/OR Fitlers is to use an AND filter when you really mean OR. Consider the following example:
                .panel.panel-danger
                  .panel-body "I want to see this information for all clients who are from Battambang AND who are from Siem Reap."
                %p People commonly put this filter together, assuming this will bring them information from all their clients who are from Battambang, and all their clients who are from Siem Reap. However, the system will instead try to find clients who are from both provinces at the same time, and find no results. The correct Fitlers would actually be:
                .panel.panel-danger
                  .panel-body "I want to see this information for all clients who are from Battambang OR who are from Siem Reap."
